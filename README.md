This project consists of two Crowdin integrations, once with `next-intl` using Next.js and once using `react-i18next` with React.
It also features a development and `main`-branch to add new translations on the go, while they are not yet on the `main`-branch.
Using `develop` and `main` branch is optional. Trunk based development is feasible as well.
